This project tackles rainfall prediction on a large, raw dataset. The primary challenge involved extensive data preprocessing and cleaning to prepare the data for modeling. Following this, various models were trained and compared, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and a Neural Network, to identify the most effective algorithm for forecasting precipitation from a large-scale dataset.
